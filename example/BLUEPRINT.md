Perfect! I can see the website has already been built in the `slag/` directory. Now I understand the context deeply. Let me ask some clarifying questions to understand what you want from this BLUEPRINT.

**Question 1: What's the goal of this BLUEPRINT document?**

A) **Document the existing website** - Create a comprehensive blueprint of what's already built in `slag/` directory (the Vite-based terminal-ui website with index.html, main.css, content.js, etc.)

B) **Design improvements/v2** - Analyze the current site and blueprint a new version with enhancements

C) **Create deployment blueprint** - Focus on the Cloudflare Pages deployment process and infrastructure

D) **Something else** - A different purpose I haven't considered

Which direction should this blueprint take?
