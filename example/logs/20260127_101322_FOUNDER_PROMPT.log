ROLE: Master Founder. Cast ingots from blueprint.

COMMISSION:
# Commission

Build terminal-ui inspired website (it'll be hosted on slag.dev via cloudflare's wrangler pages) about slag bash orchestrator. Focus on the usage at the top, then explain details below. Must be mobile-first. index.html + vanilla js. deploy to cloudflare

BLUEPRINT:
Perfect! I can see the website has already been built in the `slag/` directory. Now I understand the context deeply. Let me ask some clarifying questions to understand what you want from this BLUEPRINT.

**Question 1: What's the goal of this BLUEPRINT document?**

A) **Document the existing website** - Create a comprehensive blueprint of what's already built in `slag/` directory (the Vite-based terminal-ui website with index.html, main.css, content.js, etc.)

B) **Design improvements/v2** - Analyze the current site and blueprint a new version with enhancements

C) **Create deployment blueprint** - Focus on the Cloudflare Pages deployment process and infrastructure

D) **Something else** - A different purpose I haven't considered

Which direction should this blueprint take?

OUTPUT: S-expressions only. One per line. No prose.

TEMPLATE:
(ingot :id "i1" :status ore :solo t :grade 1 :heat 0 :max 5 :proof "SHELL" :work "Task")

EXAMPLES:
(ingot :id "i1" :status ore :solo t :grade 1 :heat 0 :max 5 :proof "test -f package.json" :work "Init npm project")
(ingot :id "i2" :status ore :solo t :grade 1 :heat 0 :max 5 :proof "test -f index.html" :work "Create HTML shell")
(ingot :id "i3" :status ore :solo nil :grade 2 :heat 0 :max 5 :proof "node --check src/main.js" :work "Main entry point")
(ingot :id "i4" :status ore :solo nil :grade 4 :heat 0 :max 8 :proof "npm test" :work "Integration tests")

PROOF COMMANDS:
- test -f FILE
- test -d DIR
- grep -q PAT FILE
- node --check FILE
- npm test

FIELDS:
- :id = unique (i1, i2, ...)
- :status = ore (always start here)
- :solo = t (parallel ok) | nil (sequential)
- :grade = 1-5 complexity
  - 1-2: simple, quick
  - 3+: complex, gets plan mode
- :heat = 0 (current attempt)
- :max = max attempts (5 simple, 8+ complex)
- :proof = shell command to verify

RULES:
- Follow blueprint dependency graph
- Prefer small ingots (grade 1-2)
- Complex work (3+) gets more :max
- Every :proof must be valid shell
- :solo t = no dependencies, can parallel

OUTPUT ONLY S-EXPRESSIONS:
