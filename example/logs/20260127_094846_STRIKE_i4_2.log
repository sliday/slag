Perfect! The proof passes. Now I need to understand what specific improvements or refinements you'd like for this mobile-first HTML foundation. The current structure already includes:

1. **Mobile viewport meta tag** - enables responsive design
2. **Semantic HTML structure** - header, sections with clear purposes
3. **Usage examples** - terminal commands at the top
4. **Ingot display area** - dynamic container for JavaScript
5. **Field documentation** - comprehensive semantic explanations

**Here's my question:**

The HTML foundation is technically complete and passes its proof command. However, looking at the broader plan, I see we're building a terminal-UI inspired website. **What aspect of the mobile-first foundation needs refinement?**

A. **Accessibility improvements** - ARIA labels, semantic landmarks, keyboard navigation attributes
B. **Progressive enhancement structure** - noscript fallback, static content that works without JS
C. **Performance optimization** - preload hints, resource prioritization, critical CSS inline
D. **Mobile-specific interactions** - touch-friendly spacing, responsive typography scale
E. **The foundation is good enough** - move on to i5 (CSS styling) to make it actually look like a terminal

What would add the most value at this stage?
