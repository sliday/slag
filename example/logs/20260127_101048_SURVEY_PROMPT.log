Build terminal-ui inspired website (it'll be hosted on slag.dev via cloudflare's wrangler pages) about slag bash orchestrator. Focus on the usage at the top, then explain details below. Must be mobile-first. index.html + vanilla js. deploy to cloudflare

Create a thorough BLUEPRINT:

## 1. OVERVIEW
What are we building? 2-3 sentence summary.

## 2. COMPONENTS
List each major piece:
- Name
- Purpose
- Complexity (1-5)
- Dependencies (what it needs)

## 3. ARCHITECTURE
```
dir/
├── file structure
└── layout
```
Key interfaces and data flow.

## 4. DEPENDENCY GRAPH
```
[A] ──▶ [B] ──▶ [C]
         │
         └────▶ [D]
```
What must be forged first?

## 5. RISKS
- High complexity areas
- Integration dangers
- External dependencies

## 6. FORGING SEQUENCE
Optimal order:
1. Foundation (no deps, parallel ok)
2. Core logic
3. Integration
4. Polish

## 7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
How do we know it's done?
- Tests
- Features
- Quality checks

Be thorough. This guides all forging.
Output clean markdown.
